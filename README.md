Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory
By: Omari Bennett

Requirements:
	API Usage:
		12 random users are pulled from the the API. New random employee information displays each time the page refreshes
	User Directory:
		The directory includes the following: Employee Image, First and Last Name, Email, & City.
	Modal Window: 
		Modal window displays the following details: Employee image, Name, Email, Cell Number, Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code, Birthdate, & There is a way to close the modal window.
	Matching the Mockups:
		Directory has been styled so that all the major elements are in place and roughly matches the mockups

Exceeds Expectations:
	I'm shooting for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade by:
		User Directory -
			Employees can be filtered by name or username
		Modal Window -
			Functionality has been added to switch back and forth between employees when the detail modal window is open.
	Note: N/A
	Bugs: N/A
